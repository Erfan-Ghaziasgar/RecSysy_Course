# 📚 Building Recommender Systems with Machine Learning and AI

This repository contains my hands-on practice, exercises, and homework solutions from the Udemy course:  
[**Building Recommender Systems with Machine Learning and AI**](https://www.udemy.com/course/building-recommender-systems-with-machine-learning-and-ai/)

## 🧠 What I’m Learning

- Fundamentals of recommender systems
- Content-based filtering
- Collaborative filtering (user-based & item-based)
- Matrix Factorization (SVD, FunkSVD, Alternating Least Squares)
- Deep Learning-based recommenders (Neural CF, Autoencoders)
- Evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, Precision@K, Hit Rate, etc.)
- Building hybrid and production-ready systems
